Communication between satellites and ground stations (known as lasercomms) is currently a very exciting area in the NewSpace sector.

As small satellites are launched in greater volumes, both as standalone craft and in constellations, the ability to efficiently communicate with them while in orbit can open up new opportunities for operators and end-users.

This is an increasingly active area of research and development. NASA has already demonstrated laser communication between CubeSats in orbit and Dr Richard Welle, Senior Scientist in the Space Applications Laboratory at the federally funded research and development center (FFRDC) Aerospace, has stated that free-space lasers will be the “the hands-down winner” when it comes to CubeSat-to-ground communication (source).

In this article we take a closer look at an advanced lasercomms product produced by Satsearch Member Hyperion Technologies called CubeCat, which is revolutionising the field and opening up new possibilities for smallsat operators, constellations and mission designers.

## Introduction to CubeCat

In some respects, the satellite-ground datalink has seen only limited innovation over recent years compared to other aspects of small satellites.

While advances in launch solutions, in-space propulsion, CubeSat structural design, onboard electronics and miniaturisation have typically grabbed the headlines, operators have often accepted limits to in-orbit data transmission as unavoidable in a smallsat mission.

Hyperion’s CubeCat is seeking to change this dynamic – opening up new capabilities by facilitating faster, more efficient data exchange.

The CubeCat system is a bidirectional communications module that enables space-to-ground data transfer between a CubeSat and a ground station facility with optical communications equipment.

The product is designed specifically for CubeSats and conforms to the typical size, mass and power requirements that such systems use. It weighs less than 1.33 kg and requires a maximum of 15 W of power while fully operational.

A data exchange step-change

Effective laser communication with orbiting CubeSats could provide a significant upgrade to satellite operators’ current management and use of data.

To facilitate this the CubeCat features a downlink data rate of 1 Gbps (maximum) and an uplink data rate of 200 kbps.

When paired with an optical ground station this offers the potential to increase data exchange volumes by an order of magnitude or more; representing a true step-change to typical smallsat operations.

Hyperion Technologies aims to help satellite owners get to the stage where the security and capacity of the datalink can be relied on and is not an operational limitation. This would bring with it several important benefits:

**Simplified licensing through radio-free communication**

* One of the major advantages of the CubeCat is its reliance on optical laser data transmission rather than radio wave signals.
* The use of optical signals avoids the need to acquire complicated radio frequency licenses – which can be a difficult and time-consuming process.
* Satellite owners can circumvent this issue with laser-based communications that operate outside of radio frequencies and still provide secure, efficient data exchange at a higher capacity and speed.

2. Flexible performance through powerful data capacity in a small physical footprint



With a mass of less than 1.33 kg and volume of 1U (10x10x10 cm³), the CubeCat is a compact product.



This enables satellite designers to incorporate it into a wide range of systems with relative ease – bringing advanced communication and data exchange capability without compromising the space available for other sub-systems or significantly increasing transit and launch costs.



3. Low demand on host ADCS



When any new component or module is added to a small satellite the overall system needs to be fully tested to ensure that in-flight dynamics and performance won’t be affected.



Alongside optimised physical dimensions, the CubeCat also features a built-in attitude determination and control error compensation system that helps ensure such disruption is minimised.



This lowers the demand on the host satellite’s Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) for more consistent and high-performing operations.



4. Ability to enhance a wide range of satellites with the modular, plug-and-play device



Another key benefit that the CubeCat can bring to smallsat applications is the ability to easily incorporate it into an array of different satellites.



The system is modular and requires no external electronics in order to operate effectively. It also interfaces easily with other onboard sub-systems using common USB 3.0, I2C technology.

5. High data capacities

The data volumes produced by smallsats and constellations are growing rapidly.

With downlink speeds of up to 1 Gbps, an uplink data rate of 200 Kbps and in-built management capabilities to enhance efficiency, the CubeCat will enable operators to cope with this growing demand.

The system features an on-board data management system with a large (64 Gb) data storage buffer and built-in data coding and synchronization.

This allows the CubeCat to turn virtually any CubeSat into a high-performing payload able to communicate to the optical ground station faster and in higher volume.

## In conclusion

Laser communication could be a game-changer for many different smallsat applications and systems.

Increasingly we’re seeing a demand from both satellite owners and end-users in other industry sectors for greater performance and higher service levels, often in a technology-agnostic manner.

With so few solutions on the market, manufacturers who begin to incorporate more effective communication technology like Hyperion’s CubeCat can offer a true point of differentiation to help them stand out in the industry.

This is a fast-moving area of development and we’re looking forward to seeing how things progress over the next few years. If you’d like to follow along with us, please sign-up to our mailing list below.
